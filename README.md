## Description:
Many boardgamers know the struggle to find enough space in their Kallax for new boardgames. Thus being able to store everything from expansion in the 
the box of the basegame is always nice.

This organizer will help you to put everything from the Basegame of wingspan and its first two expansions (European & Oceania) into one box. 
Container have lids which are held together with **5x1mm magnets**. You can just glue the magnets with cyanoacrylate (superglue) into their slots. You need to be **extremly cautions** of the polarity of the magnets and their lids. If you glue them the wrong way, the lid will be pushed away by the container. 
You can remove magnets by melting the printed part with a hair drier or a hot air gun if you mess up placing the magnets the right side up. You will need to reprint the part though.

You need a total of **48 Magnets**.

I used these magnets from amazon: https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07T13H3R5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
